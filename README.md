# Diabetes-Prediction
Can we evaluate a person as having diabetes or not according to various medical values ​​before being diagnosed? Which medical data point to diabetes for this?


# About The Project
The objective of this project is to classify whether someone has diabetes or not. So, the high-level question is “Can we be
able to predict if someone suffers from diabetes before diagnosing her/him?” Dataset consists of several Medical Variables
(Independent) and one Outcome Variable (Dependent). The independent variables in this data set are: ’Pregnancies’, ’Glucose’,
’Blood Pressure’, ’Skin Thickness’, ’Insulin’, ’BMI’, ’Diabetes Pedigree Function’, ’Age’ The outcome variable
value is either 1 or 0 indicating whether a person has diabetes (1) or not (0).


# Conclusion
As a result, we analyzed our data to answer our highlevel question (“Can we be able to predict if someone suffers
from diabetes before diagnosing her/him?”. Although we found some medical features that were highly correlated with
diabetes(Glucose, BMI and Age), we could not conclude that the one with a high value is definitely diabetic. However, in
the results we obtained, if the factors affecting the state of diabetes are present in the individual at the same time ( ex.:
an elderly person with a high glucose level and who has given multiple) birth, it is possible to keep the risk of diabetes.
